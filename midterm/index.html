        <h2>Life of a starfish</h2>
        <img src="images/lone-starfish.jpg" alt="Starfish image"/>
        <p>Well, you must be knowing that all starfish do not have exactly five arms. The number of arms can actually exceed even 40 in some species. A starfish can easily glide through the water on its arms by doing a little twist and turn to each arm. This is how it escapes from its predators. Some starfish can grow as big as a meter and a half.starfish are fascinating creatures with a unique set of adaptations that allow them to thrive in diverse marine environments. Their ability to regenerate, along with their important ecological roles, make them an integral part of marine ecosystems.</p>

    <h2>Facts about a starfish</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In spite of the fact that they are viewed as slow-moving and docile creatures, most of the starfish species are savage hunters. When a starfish's tube feet are moving back and forth, water is sucked into the excellent water vascular system that starfish have and enables the creature to move over the ocean bottom.</li>
        <li>Now let's talk about their reproduction. They make more starfish by sexual or asexual means. They can breed both sexually and asexually at any time of the year. Usually, starfish reproduce sexually. First, the male starfish ejects sperm into the water, then the females take the sperm in through their skin, and the egg is fertilized.</li>
        <li>A chief enemy of the starfish is fish. Small kinds of fish normally nibble on the feet of starfish alive. It is also said that when starfish are captured by fish, they do not have the force to release themselves. Furthermore, larger kinds of fish have been identified to feed on the body of the starfish itself.</li>
        <li>Starfish live in oceans and seas. You can find them in pretty much any saltwater environment. While starfish can live in deep water, you don't find as many there. Some of the places where you might find starfish include the waters around Australia, the North and Baltic Seas, and the Mediterranean Sea. Starfish are also found in the coldest of oceans, the Arctic and the Antarctic.</li>
